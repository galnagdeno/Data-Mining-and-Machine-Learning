# Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning
Data mining and machine learning algorithms implemented in Python based on the algorithms outlined in `Data Mining and Machine Learning: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms`, by Mohammed J. Zaki and Wagner Meira.

### Disclaimer
This is a study project. As for this moment, the algorithms in this repository are not intended to be used in any serious analysis. The algorithms were implemented in a more or less literal manner in relation to the pseudo-codes outlined in the book. Also, the inputs and outputs are not treated uniformly in similar algorithms and the implementations were poorly tested.
